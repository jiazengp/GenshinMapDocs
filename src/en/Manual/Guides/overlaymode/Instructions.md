## [Overlay Mode] Instructions
## Introduction
Overlay Mode <span style="color: green"><b>displays the map client </b></span>over the <span style="color: red"><b>Genshin game window</b></span>. The mode benefits players who only have one monitor, making switching between game and map much faster.

## Instructions
  -   Overlay Mode only functions properly when the Genshin is running under a non-fullscreen mode
  -   For users who prefer a fullscreen experience, please follow the instructions in: <a href="Borderless Windowed Fullscreen 无边框全屏\Launching The Game in Windowed Fullscreen.md">Launching The Game in Windowed Fullscreen</a>
  - The map cannot be summoned to the top when Genshin is in exclusive fullscreen. Try setting Genshin to windowed, quitting, or use the **Alt+Enter** shortcut to switch it to windowed without changing the game resolution
  -   When Overlay Mode is turned on, a tip will be displayed.

  - Pressing **Alt+M**, **M**, **Esc**, or clicking on the close button at right-top corner will hide the map client and return you to the game

  - Once Overlay Mode is enabled successfully, a **Paimon Icon** displays on the left of minimap in game
  - If the Paimon Icon does not appear, the **PopTips** likely loaded unsuccessfully. This may be casued by system permission denial, you can launch PopTips plugin manually by executing **_map folder location_\Map_Data\Plugins\x86_64\tips.exe**

  - You can drag the Paimon Icon to change its position
  - Either double clicking on Paimon Icon or pressing Alt+M can summon the map
  - Right clicking on Paimon Icon in system tray allow customization of shortcut keybinds. (Sorry for lack in translation for this part)

  - Firewalls may cause failure in launching Overlay Mode. We hope we can solve this problem in the coming future.

## FAQs
  - If the shortcut conflicts with another shortcut, you can delete all files in hotkey cache directory. After the deletion, the shortcut will be reset to its default: **Alt+M**.
