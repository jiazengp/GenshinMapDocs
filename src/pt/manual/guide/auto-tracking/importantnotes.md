## Troubleshooting {#Troubleshooting}

Some facts to know before troubleshooting and submitting feedback:

1. Position Tracker is based on image recognition, it does not read or modify the game process, thus it brings no risk of an account ban.
2. The image recognition is not highly accurate, it's normal for the player indicator to shift sporadically. This cannot be resolved completely due to the limitations of the technology implemented.
3. Please check if your desired range of settings and feature is supported above.
4. The following troubleshooting files can help us identify an issue, please attach them with your feedback if possible:
   - Tracking log (autoTrack.log)
   - Tracking screenshot (Capture.png)
