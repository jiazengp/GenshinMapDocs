# [Background Usage] Framerate/Tracking Control

## Framerate Control

[Foreground Frame Rate] and [Background Frame Rate] can be configured in the General settings, it is recommended to reduce resource utilization by setting [Foreground Frame Rate] to 30-50 fps and [Background Frame Rate] to 1-10 fps, thus minimizing fps loss in-game.

If you wish to use the [Stay on Top] feature, which pins the map client window on top despite being out of focus, it is recommended to match both frame rate settings' values.
