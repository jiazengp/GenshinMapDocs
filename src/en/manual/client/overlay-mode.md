## Introduction

Overlay Mode <span style="color: green"><b>displays the map client</b></span> over the <span style="color: red"><b>Genshin game window</b></span>. This mode benefits players who only have one monitor, allowing quicker switching between the game and the map client.

## Instructions

- Overlay Mode only functions properly when the Genshin is running under a non-fullscreen mode
- For users who prefer a fullscreen experience, please follow the instructions in: [Launching The Game in Windowed Fullscreen](./fullscreen-windowed)
- The map cannot be summoned to the top when Genshin is in exclusive fullscreen. Try setting Genshin to windowed, quitting, or using the **Alt+Enter** shortcut to switch it to windowed without changing the game resolution
- When Overlay Mode is enabled, a tip is displayed.

- Once Overlay Mode is enabled successfully, a **Paimon Icon** displays on the left of the minimap in-game
- If the Paimon Icon does not appear, **PopTips** likely loaded unsuccessfully. This may be caused by system permission denial, you can launch the **PopTips** plugin manually by executing `map_folder_directory_\Map_Data\Plugins\x86_64\tips.exe`
